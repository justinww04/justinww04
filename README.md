Hey, My name is Justin Whitman and I am a soon to be graduate of BloomTech. I am a fullstack developer am and I am ready to get out there and start working. I believe that on the job work experience is where you learn the real skills so I hope to find a company once I am graduated that will give me the chance to show what I got. 


I have all of the fundemental skills such as programming, databases, debugging, problem-solving and many more that it takes to be a software developer, but I am excited to learn more and become better while working for a company that wants to see me succeed.
